# Fix VMS

The USS Connecticut is an engineering marvel. Its nuclear power plant propels to classified speeds. Its unique hull material secures watertight integrity to classified depths. Its double deck torpedo room services eight torpedo tubes, twice the number found on other submarines. 

In war, it's the apex predator of the ocean.

Yet, despite all of this, the navigational software on the $3B warship is far less capable any maps app on your phone. The software, called "Voyage Management System" (VMS), is the hub of all the ship's planning. But it can't even do basic, safety-of-ship alerting. 

You want to try and dive down to 350FT even though the seafloor is at 300FT? No problem, VMS will let you do that with no alerting, even though it knows both the ship's depth and the seafloor's depth.

We don't know why the Connecticut hit a seamount. But I'm certain VMS didn't help the watchteam avoid the accident. The Submarine Force has lived with  inadequate navigation software for too long. Let's explore the role of VMS in submarine operations and understand its shortcomings. By the end, I hope you agree that **it's time we fix VMS.**

Ever wonder how submarines plan operations? Probably not. But I'm going to cover the basics to show just how poorly VMS supports navigation teams.

```For the submariners, bear with me through some simplifications. ```

One submarine's chunk of the ocean is called its "waterspace." Shore-based offices, like air-traffic controllers, assign submarines waterspace. Once assigned waterspace, a submarine's navigation team plans how to use the space. 

VMS is the hub for all this planning on the submarine. The navigation team takes the waterspace coordinates and manually inputs them into VMS. Then, they build their navigation plans using the software. These plans have three elements:

1. Location - What is the latitude/longitude?
2. Depth - What are the minimum and maximum operating depths?
3. Time - When is the submarine to be at its location and depth?

What happens if a team gets the plan wrong? Well, if they set the maximum operating depth deeper than the seafloor, a grounding happens. Let's cover how we prevent this from happening. Hint: VMS is of no help.

VMS doesn't add any value to the process. It's as if our arcane procurement process and the software designers collaborated to absolve themselves from any responsibility by serving us such an aggressively unhelpul tool. One can imagine them thinking, "Well, if we did the most basic alerting and warnings, and a grounding happened, we might get blamed. So let's not do anything."
