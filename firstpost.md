# Fix VMS

The USS Connecticut is an engineering marvel. Its nuclear power plant propels to classified speeds. Its unique hull material secures watertight integrity to classified depths. Its double deck torpedo room services eight torpedo tubes, twice the number found on other submarines. 

In war, it's the apex predator of the ocean.

Yet, despite all of this, the navigational software on the $3B warship is far less capable any maps app on your phone. The software, called "Voyage Management System" (VMS), is the hub of all the ship's planning. But it can't even do basic, safety-of-ship alerting. 

You want to try and dive down to 350FT even though the seafloor is at 300FT? No problem, VMS will let you do that with no alerting, even though it knows both the ship's depth and the seafloor's depth.

We don't know why the Connecticut hit a seamount. But I'm certain VMS didn't help the watchteam avoid the accident. The Submarine Force has lived with  inadequate navigation software for too long. **It's time we fix VMS.**
